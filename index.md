This is the onboarding page of CEU MicroData. If you are here for the first time, welcome to the team! If you are revisiting something or
upgrading this page it's at least as good!

This is how this page works: We have lessons designed for you that are going to guide you through some of the most important tools, data and 
procedures we work with. It is designed to help you throughout your time here at the MicroData. Hopefully it contains information that you
will often revisit and learn from. Nevertheless, it definitely doesn't replace learning from your peers. Whenever you run into any questions
that a quick google search / Stack Overflow can't answer, make sure that you ask them on Slack. Even better: If you find out the answer you
may want to add it here, so that others will find it more easily.

Enjoy both the lessons and your time at MicroData!

> ## Prerequisites
>
> Make sure that you have a signed contract. Even though some lessons are useful in general, it is best if you have full access to the
> microdata resources (e.g. server, slack, github, etc.) first. To gain access to every resource, you need a CEU-issued e-mail address,
> which you should receive shortly after signing your contract.
